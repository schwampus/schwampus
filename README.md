<p>Currently a student at IT-HÃ¶gskolan in Gothenburg, Sweden learning WebDev with a focus on <b>JavaScript</b>. <br>
Becoming a <b>FULLSTACK DEVELOPER</b> I get to combine all of my skillsets: a problem solver, creator of things & designer.</p>
<p>
Prior to my coding journey I had Photo/Video & Graphic Design as my biggest hobbies which led me to study <b>Digital Design</b> at YRGO. After that I worked a couple of years in Video Production at two different agencies here in Gothenburg. <br>
I was an Editor / Motion Designer / Colorist the days spent at the office, out on set I was a First AC, Drone Pilot and of course also a Camera Operator. </p>

When I'm not on my computer I'm either outside running or maybe flying one of my FPV Drones.
