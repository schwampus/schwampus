Currently a student at IT-HÃ¶gskolan in Gothenburg, Sweden learning WebDev with a focus on <b>JavaScript</b> . 

Prior to my coding journey I had Graphic Design and Photo/Video as one of my biggest hobbies which led me to study Digital Design at YRGO. After that I worked a couple of years in Video Production at two different agencies here in Gothenburg.
I was an Editor / Motion Designer / Colorist the days spent at the office, out on set I was a First AC, Drone Pilot and of course also a Camera Operator. 

I am now combining all of my skillsets, a problem solver, creator of things & designer into one great package as a <b><font color='green'>FULLSTACK DEVELOPER.</font></b>

When I'm not on my computer I'm either outside running or maybe flying one of my FPV Drones.
